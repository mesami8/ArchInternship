#TaskNo1

Build A Streamlit Interface For A Locally 
Installed LLM
 Create a simple and interactive Streamlit web interface that connects to a locally
 installed large language model (LLM) running via Ollama. The interface should
 include a text input box for user queries and a response area to display
 modelgenerated answers. Ensure smooth communication between the Streamlit
 frontend and the LLM back-end using appropriate API calls or local endpoints. Add
 basic features like a conversation history panel and a reset button to enhance
 usability.


 #TaskNo2
Medical Finetuning With Qlora Using Unsloth In Colab
Implement a QLoRA-based fine-tuning workflow for a medical language model
using Unsloth’s prebuilt notebooks in Google Colab. Load a domain-specific medical
dataset (e.g., clinical Q&A pairs), configure Unsloth to run 4-bit quantized low-rank
adaptation on a base model like Llama 3 or DeepSeek-R1, and execute the training
workflow including tokenization, adapter setup, and epoch-based training. Monitor
memory use and performance via Colab, save your fine-tuned adapter, and test the
model’s responses on new medical queries. This project helps you learn efficient
PEFT workflows, memory-saving techniques, and how to adapt models to
specialized medical domains
